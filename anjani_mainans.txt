Answer: EGG

Reason: In nature,living things evolve through chnges in their DNA. So we can say that chickens evolved 
from non-chickens(creatures infinitesimally close to chickens) through small changes caused by the mixing
of male and female DNA or by mutations to the DNA that produced the zygote. That is, two non-chickens 
might have mated and thier zygote contained the mutuations that prouduced the first true chicken. So, 
the egg might have come first.
